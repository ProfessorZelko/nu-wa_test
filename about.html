        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>In March of the year 2015, Hi-Rez Studios, an independent American video game company, released thei magnum opus. This 3rd person MOBA used gods and goddesses from various cultures and pantheons across the world to battle for control of Earth. A truly unique prespective on the genre, but this is not about such tales. Although Smite focused on many deities, one lad would insert himself as the reincarnation of Sisyphus. Brian P. Garner, better known as Tuccaroo, would find himself in a struggle to prove to his peers that he was in fact not a mid Nu Wa.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In Chinese mythology, Nu Wa is the maternal goddess. She is given credit for creating and shaping man as well as repairing the Pillar of Heaven after its destruction during an era of great turmoil. In Smite, Nu Wa is a mage with abilities to summon terra cotta soldiers, blast her enemies with metallic shards, and rain down fiery comets on the enemy team. While these abilities are thematic with her lore and strong in their own right, it does naught to save teams from this perpertual bottom frag, Tuccaroo.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What began as a small endeavor into a role and god with which he was not familiar, became a curse upon his legacy. The bellows from his rotund form would echo through the lands, only quieting as the cacaphonous laughter of his peers flooded the chat. You would think these repeated failures would eat away at the edges of one's sanity, but for Tuccaroo such Einsteinian parables find no purchase. Although the frequency of play for this god has fallen off, he still returns to try and hold that boulder at the top of the hill. As much as this site is banter, it is also a testament to the sheer incalcubility of Tuccaroo's lack of skill with this particular mage.</p>
